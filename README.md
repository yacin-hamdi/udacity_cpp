# Udacity - C++ Nanodegree Program

The summary of my learnings in Udacity's CPPND program.  
The program first walks you through Object-Oriented Programming concepts and then gets you exposed to Modern C++ features.

## Installation

Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/yacin-hamdi/udacity_cpp.git`

## Build Instructions

See the build instructions in each project folder.

## [Project 1 - Route Planning](https://github.com/yacin-hamdi/udacity_cpp/tree/main/1-CppND-Route-Planning)

In this project, we create a route planner between two points on real map data. The optimal path between the starting point and the ending point can be found by implementing A* search algorithm.

## [Project 2 - System Monitor](https://github.com/yacin-hamdi/udacity_cpp/tree/main/project-2-system_monitoring)

In this project, we build a system monitor that resemble the program [htop](https://htop.dev/), which is a standard program for monitoring Linux systems.
