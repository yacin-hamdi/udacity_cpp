    "In the previous concept, you saw how to create a `Car` classs and use a constructor. At the end of that concept, your code looked like this:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "#include <iostream>\n",
    "#include <string>\n",
    "using std::string;\n",
    "using std::cout;\n",

    "class Car {\n",

    "If you were planning to build a larger program, at this point it might be good to put your class definition and function declarations into a separate file. Just as when we discussed header files before, putting the class definition into a separate header helps to organize your code, and prevents problems with trying to use class objects before the class is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two things to note in the code below. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. When the class methods are defined outside the class, the _scope resolution operator_ `::` must be used to indicate which class the method belongs to. For example, in the definition of the `PrintCarData` method you see:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```cpp\n",
    "  void Car::PrintCarData()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This prevents any compiler issues if there are are two classes with methods that have the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We have changed how the constructor initializes the variables. Instead of the previous constructor:\n",
    "  ```cpp\n",
    "  Car(string c, int n) {\n",
    "      color = c; \n",
    "      number = n;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  the constructor now uses an [_initializer list_](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/initializer_list):\n",
    "  ```cpp\n",
    "  Car(string c, int n) : color(c), number(n) {}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Here, the class members are initialized before the body of the constructor (which is now empty). Initializer lists are a quick way to initialize many class attributes in the constructor. Additionally, the compiler treats attributes initialized in the list slightly differently than if they are initialized in the constructor body. For reasons beyond the scope of this course, if a class attribute is a reference, it must be initialized using an initializer list.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Variables that don't need to be visible outside of the class are set as `private`. This means that they can not be accessed outside of the class, which [prevents them from being accidentally changed](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rc-private).\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the cells below to see this code in practice. In this code, we have separated the class into declarations and definitions, with declarations being in the `.h` file and definitions being in `.cpp`. Note that only the `.h` file needs to be included in any other file where the definitions are used.\n",
