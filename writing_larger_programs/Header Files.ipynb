    "Notice that the code from the first example was fixed without having to rearrange the functions! In the code above, you might also have noticed several other things:\n",
    "- The function declarations in the header file don't need variable names, just variable types. You can put names in the declaration, however, and doing this often makes the code easier to read.\n",
    "- The `#include` statement for the header used quotes `\" \"` around the file name, and not angle brackets `<>`. We have stored the header in the same directory as the `.cpp` file, and the quotes tell the preprocessor to look for the file in the same directory as the current file - not in the usual set of directories where libraries are typically stored.\n",
    "- Finally, there is a preprocessor directive:\n",
    "  ```cpp\n",
    "  #ifndef HEADER_EXAMPLE_H\n",
    "  #define HEADER_EXAMPLE_H\n",
    "  ``` \n",
    "  at the top of the header, along with an `#endif` at the end. This is called an \"include guard\". Since the header will be included into another file, and `#include` just pastes contents into a file, the include guard prevents the same file from being pasted multiple times into another file. This might happen if multiple files include the same header, and then are all included into the same `main.cpp`, for example. \n",
    "  The `ifndef` checks if `HEADER_EXAMPLE_H` has not been defined in the file already. If it has not been defined yet, then it is defined with `#define HEADER_EXAMPLE_H`, and the rest of the header is used. If `HEADER_EXAMPLE_H` has already been defined, then the preprocessor does not enter the `ifndef` block.\n",
    "  **Note:** There are other ways to do this. Another common way is to use an `#pragma once`preprocessor directive, but we won't cover that in detail here. See [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard) for examples."
